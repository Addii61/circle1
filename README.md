Introduction
The "TestCircle" project contains a simple Java program for working with circles. It defines a Circle class that allows you to create circle objects, set their radii, and calculate their areas and circumferences. The main class, TestCircle, demonstrates the usage of the Circle class.

Code Structure
The project consists of two Java files:

Circle.java: This file contains the definition of the Circle class. It includes methods for setting the radius, getting the radius, calculating the area, and calculating the circumference of a circle.

TestCircle.java: This file is the main class that demonstrates how to use the Circle class. It creates three circle objects, sets their radii, and calculates and displays their areas and circumferences.

Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Open a Java development environment (e.g., NetBeans, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA).

Create a new Java project and add the two Java files (Circle.java and TestCircle.java) to the project.

Compile and run the TestCircle class to execute the code.

You will see the areas and circumferences of three circles (c1, c2, and c3) displayed in the console.

Sample Output
Here's an example of what the output may look like:
--------------------------
63.62
14.14
--------------------------
--------------------------
38.48
12.25
--------------------------
--------------------------
132.73
42.25
--------------------------
This output shows the area and circumference calculations for three different circles with radii 4.5, 3.5, and 6.5, respectively.

Feel free to modify the code or integrate it into your own projects as needed.

Enjoy using the "TestCircle" Java code!
